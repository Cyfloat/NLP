# Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal is to predict whether a given text review expresses a positive or negative sentiment.

## Project Overview

- The code provided in this repository performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of restaurant reviews.
- It uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their content.
- The text data is preprocessed, transformed into a numerical format using the Bag of Words model, and then used to train and evaluate the model.
